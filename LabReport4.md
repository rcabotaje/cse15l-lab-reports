1. `ssh cs15sp23hl@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>`, typed my password, `<enter>`. I used the `ssh` command to log into my ieng6 account, and used `<enter>` to run the command and to enter my password.

2.`git <space> clone <space> <Ctrl+V><enter>` I used the `git clone` command to clone my fork of the lab7 repository into my ieng6 account. Then I copied the link of the repository and used `<Ctrl+V>` to paste it after the `git clone` command to clone that exact repository into my ieng6 account as the repository link was in my clipboard. Also used `<enter>` to run the command and `<space>` to separate the commands from the arguments.

3. `cd <space> lab7 <enter>`, `bash <space> test.sh<enter>` I used the `cd` command to cd into the lab7 directory, then used the `bash` command to run the commands inside the `test.sh` file and to see the tests fail. Also used `<enter>` to run the command and `<space>` to separate the commands from the arguments.

4.`vim <space> ListExamples.java <enter> /index1 <enter> nnnnnnnnn lllll r2 :wq` Used the `vim` command to go into the `ListExamples.java` file used the `/search` command to find the `index1` to switch, then used the `n` vim command to look at each instance of `index1` and find the right one to switch. Then used the `l` to put the cursor over the number to switch and used `r` command to replace the `1` character to `2` and finally used `:wq` to exit and save the file. Also used `<enter>` to run the command and `<space>` to separate the commands from the arguments.

 6. `git <space> add ListE<tab>.<tab><enter>``git <space>' 'commit <space>' '-m <space> "thing has been commited<enter>"' 'git <space> push <Ctrl+V><Enter>` Used git add to add the file, used git commit to commit it to the repository, then used git push to push it to my GitHub account's public repository. I used <tab> after typing `ListE` to autofill the filename to `ListExamples` and after `.` to autofill the filetype to `.java`. Also used `<enter>` to run the command and `<space>` to separate the commands from the arguments. Used `<Ctrl+V>` as the repository I wanted to push it to `(git@github.com:rcabotaje/lab7.git)`  was on my clipboard.
